    "text": "Here is an overview of the resale process:\nLog in to My Flat Dashboard on HDB Flat Portal to start your journey. You will be guided through the following steps for the buying process:\nApply for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter on My Flat Dashboard for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. The HFE letter will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Read our frequently asked questions on the HFE letter.\nYou may request for an In-Principle Approval from the participating financial institutions when you apply for an HFE letter.\nAfter obtaining an HFE letter, you may look for a suitable flat that meets your budget and household needs.\nRead our guide on finding a flat for more information on the Resale Flat Listing (RFL) service and other resources you can use to help plan and prepare for your flat purchase.\nYou can either manage the purchase on your own or engage the service of a salesperson for a fee. Please read managing the flat purchase and consider signing up for our resale seminars to learn more about resale policies and procedures.\nObtain an Option to Purchase (OTP) from the flat seller* after you have agreed on the flat price.\n* Sellers must have registered an Intent to Sell for more than 7 days.\nIf you intend to get an HDB housing loan, you will need a valid HFE letter^ from HDB before flat sellers may grant you an OTP.\nIf you have indicated that you intend to get an HDB housing loan in your HFE application, the loan outcome will be reflected in your HFE letter accordingly.\nIf you have indicated that you intend to get a housing loan from a financial institution in your HFE application, you must have a valid Letter of Offer (LO) before you exercise the OTP. You may concurrently request an In-Principle Approval and LO from participating financial institutions when applying for the HFE letter^ on My Flat Dashboard.\n^ Refer to Steps 1 and 2 to determine if you need a valid HFE letter.\nIf you are paying for the flat purchase with CPF savings and/ or housing loan, submit a Request for Value by the next working day after you get the OTP.\nThis is not required if you are not using your CPF savings and any housing loan to pay for the flat purchase.\nIf you have requested for an IPA while applying for the HFE letter, you can convert the IPA into an LO at this step, before exercising the OTP during the Option Period.\nAfter you exercise the OTP, you and the sellers must submit the respective portions of the resale application.\nUpon receiving a complete resale application and the full set of supporting documents from you and the sellers, we will verify the eligibility of both parties and accept the resale application within 28 working days. We will prepare the necessary documents for you and the sellers to endorse, which will be ready about 3 weeks after the application has been accepted. You and the sellers must acknowledge and endorse the resale documents, and pay the necessary fees.\nAfter the documents are endorsed and fees paid, HDB will grant an approval for the resale transaction.\nResale completion is about 8 weeks from the date of HDB’s acceptance of the resale application. This is the earliest possible date to complete the transaction. If you wish to defer the completion, please discuss with your sellers and let us have a written confirmation (signed by both sellers and buyers) via MyRequest@HDB. You and the sellers will be notified via SMS of the appointment. You may also log in to My Flat Dashboard for the appointment details.\nFind out more about the HFE letter and how to apply for one to confirm your eligibility. You may also concurrently apply for an In-Principle Approval from the financial institutions for a housing loan.\nFind out about the mode of financing, registering an Intent to Buy and entering into an Option To Purchase.\nLearn about submitting a resale application and what to expect after you have submitted one.\nObtain details on the resale completion appointment and the actions to take before and during the appointment."

It ensures that there is a balanced mix of the various ethnic communities in HDB towns. The EIP limits are set at block and neighbourhood levels based on the ethnic make-up of Singapore.\nFor the purchase of an HDB flat, a household with members of different ethnic groups may choose to classify their household ethnicity under the ethnicity of any buyer(s) or spouse according to the race shown on their NRIC.\nOnce an ethnicity is chosen for the household, it will remain the same when the flat owners subsequently sell their flat on the open market.\nThe SPR quota ensures that SPR families can better integrate into the local community. Malaysians are excluded from this quota because of their close cultural and historical similarities with Singaporeans. Non-Malaysian SPR households applying to buy an HDB resale flat need to be within the SPR quota for the block (8%) and neighbourhood (5%)."
